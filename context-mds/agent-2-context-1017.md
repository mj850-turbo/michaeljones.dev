# Agent 2 Context — 17 Oct 2024

## Overview

This document captures everything modified by Agent 2 while iterating on the `michaelfjones.dev` portfolio. It consolidates UI, theme, content, and infrastructure adjustments so future work can pick up with full context.

## Work Log Summary

### Foundational UI Polish
- Modernized hero, projects, about, and contact sections with Tailwind-based gradients, shadows, and copy updates.
- Added Framer Motion entrance animations and responsive typography (`fluid-heading` utility) on the home page.
- Replaced hard-coded colors on badges, cards, and CTA components with shared CSS variables to keep styling consistent across modes.
- Removed the Lenis smooth-scroll integration (and associated helper component) when the experience felt heavy-handed.

### Theme System Architecture
- Introduced a theme context (`web/src/components/theme-provider.tsx`) with localStorage-driven persistence and support for light/dark modes plus selectable palette profiles.
- Built the theme controls UI (`web/src/components/theme-controls.tsx`) featuring a light/dark toggle, palette dropdown, and live swatch preview. Wired controls into the desktop nav and mobile sheet (`web/src/components/nav.tsx`).
- Overhauled `web/src/app/globals.css` with palette-specific CSS custom properties: background/foreground tokens, panel gradients, CTA gradients, glow colors, badge surfaces, and shared shadow values. Added a default blend palette (Canyon Dawn light + Velvet Twilight dark).
- Updated all major components/pages (`web/src/app/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/about/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/contact/page.tsx`, `web/src/components/project-card.tsx`, `web/src/components/ui/button.tsx`, `web/src/components/ui/card.tsx`, etc.) to consume the new tokens instead of literal hex codes.

### Navigation & Content Adjustments
- Simplified the nav to Projects / About / Contact while keeping social icons and theme controls (`web/src/components/nav.tsx`).
- Pointed the hero “Resume” CTA to `/about#resume` instead of the old `/resume` route.
- Converted the `/resume` page (`web/src/app/resume/page.tsx`) into a redirect that forwards visitors to the résumé section on the About page.

### Résumé Preview Experience
- Embedded the résumé PDF directly on the About page. Initial version was always expanded; later iterations made it collapsible with animated height transitions (`web/src/components/resume-preview.tsx`).
- Implemented a toggle button (with chevron icons) and ensured the preview auto-expands when the hash `#resume` is present.
- Latest iteration measures the PDF container with a `ResizeObserver` so the accordion expands to full height without guesswork. The embedded `<object>` now reports `onLoad` to trigger a re-measure.

### Contact Workflow Refinements
- Hardened the `/api/contact` handler (`web/src/app/api/contact/route.ts`): improved error handling, ensured `replyTo` is correctly passed to Resend, and converted `catch` blocks to use `unknown` types.
- Added lightweight TypeScript declaration for the `resend` package (`web/src/types/resend.d.ts`) to keep typechecking green while using the SDK.
- Updated the client-side contact form (`web/src/app/contact/page.tsx`) to mirror the stricter error handling and track submission status.

### Additional Notes
- Hero stat cards and badges now rely on palette-aware surfaces (`--badge-surface` tokens) for contrast in dark mode.
- Project cards received a richer layout with inline media, default gradient backgrounds, and a consistent “Details” link that routes to `/projects/[slug]` pages.
- Created `updates-plan.md` and other context docs earlier in the engagement; this file supersedes them with a consolidated high-level summary.

## Files of Interest

- Theme infrastructure: `web/src/components/theme-provider.tsx`, `web/src/components/theme-controls.tsx`, `web/src/app/globals.css`
- Layout & nav: `web/src/app/layout.tsx`, `web/src/components/nav.tsx`
- Key pages: `web/src/app/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/about/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/contact/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/projects/page.tsx`
- Résumé components: `web/src/components/resume-preview.tsx`, `web/src/app/resume/page.tsx`
- Contact backend/client: `web/src/app/api/contact/route.ts`, `web/src/app/contact/page.tsx`
- Shared UI: `web/src/components/project-card.tsx`, `web/src/components/ui/button.tsx`, `web/src/components/ui/badge.tsx`, `web/src/components/ui/card.tsx`

## Next Step Ideas

1. Build out the “proof strip → featured case study → services” flow sketched in the ASCII wireframes.
2. Introduce the project detail drawer/modal pattern for richer case studies.
3. Add SEO/metadata automation (sitemap, OpenGraph images) now that palettes and layout are stable.
4. Expand testing (Playwright accessibility smoke tests) once the new sections land.
